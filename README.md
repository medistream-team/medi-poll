## Documentation

[API Document](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/12457751/TzXukyiL#7e4f1f5e-1643-40df-b94c-374aed364f03)

## Clone Git repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/medistream-team/quick-survey-js.git
```

<br>

## API Server
Please refer to the following steps for establising an api server.

### 1. Install packages

After you clone git repository, go to the root directory and run `npm run install:api` to download required packages for an api server. Once the installation is done, `.env` file will be automatically created in `./src/api` directory.

```bash
npm run install:api
```

### 2. Set your DB endpoints

You should fill out `MONGO_URI` value inside `.env` at `./src/api` file first. MONGO_URI indicates MongoDB server endpoints and this is necessary to run api on either local or aws lambda.

Here is an example.
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://test:test123@example.mongodb.net/surveyDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

### 3. Check yml file

Before you run api server, you need to configure `service` and `provider` values inside serverless.yml in `./src/api`.
Default values are set as below.

```yml
service: my-survey

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs12.x
  stage: dev
  region: ap-northeast-2
```

### 4. Run server on local

To run this project on local, use `npm run dev` command.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will run serverless offline on your local, and default port 8000 will open. 
Here is an example. The `provider[stage]` value you set inside `serverless.yml` will follow the endpoints.

```
localhost:8000/dev
```

### 5. Deploy server on AWS
In `./src/api/config/aws-settings.sh`, you need to fill in `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`  and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` for a deployment. For more information, please visit this [website](http://slss.io/aws-creds-setup).


Or, to deploy your api on aws lambda via serverless framework, use `npm deploy:api` command.

```bash
npm run deploy:api
```

According to serverless documents, the console will show your endpoints. For more information, please visit [this page](https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-express-rest-api).

<br>


## Client Server
Please refer to the following steps for setting up a client server as needed.
To install the required client packages after git clone, use `npm run install:client` command. When installation is done, `.env` file will be automatically created in a `./src/client` directory. **If you have your existing api server and used `npm install quick-survey-js` command, proceed to step 2.**

```bash
npm run install:client
```

### 1. Set your API endpoints

You should fill out `API_ENDPOINTS` value inside `.env` file at `./src/client`. This indicates API server endpoints.

As an example, ðŸ‘‡

```
VUE_APP_API_ENDPOINTS=https://92pz8mf1w2.execute-api.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev
```

or ðŸ‘‡, if you're running an API server on local. 

```
VUE_APP_API_ENDPOINTS=http://localhost:8000/dev
```

### 2. Set up API in `config.js`

Set up `USER_SURVEY_API` and `ADMIN_SURVEY_API` (these names shouldn't change) in your `config.js` that each component would use as required to run the app.

#### Example

```js
//config.js
export const USER_SURVEY_API = `${VUE_APP_API_ENDPOINTS}/survey`;
export const ADMIN_SURVEY_API = `${VUE_APP_API_ENDPOINTS}/admin/survey`;
```

### 3. Run server on local

To run client server on local, run `npm run serve:client` and it will open port 8080 on local.

```
npm run serve:client
```
### 4. Import components in your Vue project

There are 3 components that you may import as needed - to create a survey, submit answers to a survey, and view survey results.
You may import the components on your existing or new application as guided below.

```js
// main.js
import { quickSurveyJS } from 'quick-survey-js';
import 'quick-survey-js/dis/quick-survey-js.css';

Vue.use(quickSurveyJS);
```

### 5. Use components

#### Example

```js
<template>
  <SurveyAdmin @survey-created="onCreated" @failed-to-create-survey="onFailed" />
</template>
```

### 6. Set required props and methods

To get the components working, there are required props to pass each.
The events emitted from each component call the methods where you can specify in your parent component what actions to be taken.
Please refer to below for **required** props and methods.

#### Create Survey

```js
<SurveyAdmin
    :userKey="yourUserKey"
    @survey-created="yourMethod"
    @failed-to-create-survey="yourMethod"
  />

```
`userKey`: used to distinguish general survey respondents, survey creators, and respondents who have already submitted answers.<br>
`survey-created`: Once the survey is created and the submit button is clicked on the browser, this event is emitted. <br>
`failed-to-create-survey`: this event is emitted once it fails to create a survey. 

#### Submit Survey

```js
<Survey
    :surveyId="yourSurveyID"
    :userKey="yourUserKey"
    @sent-vote="yourMethod"
    @voted-already="yourMethod"
    @closed-survey="yourMethod"
    @failed-to-close-survey="yourMethod"
  />
```
`surveyID`: Once a survey is created, the surveyId is created - then it can be passed as prop to Survey component which the survey page that general users can view and participate.<br>
`sent-vote`: the event emitted once the user submits an answer.<br>
`voted-already`: the event emitted once it has been confirmed that the user has already voted before.<br>
`closed-survey`: the event emitted once the survey creator chooses to close the survey immediately.<br>
`failed-to-close-survey`: the event emitted once it fails to close the survey.

#### View Survey Results

```js
<SurveyResults
    :surveyId="yourSurveyID"
    :userKey="yourUserKey"
  />
```
